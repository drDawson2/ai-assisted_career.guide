## Methodology

This guide applies established career development theories through AI-assisted analysis:

- **Protean Career Theory** (Douglas Hall) - Self-directed career management, psychological success over external markers
- **Career Construction Theory** (Mark Savickas) - Career as constructed narrative with three dimensions:
  - Life Themes (WHY) - What motivates you
  - Vocational Personality (WHAT) - Your professional identity  
  - Career Adaptability (HOW) - How you navigate change

The methodology uses these frameworks to inform questions and analysis while remaining accessible to users without theoretical background.

## Usage Tips

### For Best Results

- **Type conversationally** - many people use AI models like an adanved Google. This system works best when you type into Claude as if you are chatting, not searching.
- - **It is okay tell Claude to slow down, go back, or correct it** - Claude often provide multiple questions at once. It is okay to tell it to ask you questions one at a time or to return to previous questions if you were not finished.
- **Be honest and specific** in foundational questions - the quality of your profile depends on information you provide
- **Upload quality documents** - richer documents enable better analysis
- **Take your time** - don't rush through the questions
- **Review thoughtfully** - spend 30-60 minutes with your profile before making decisions
- **Return to your project** - use it for ongoing career support, not just initial profile

### Troubleshooting

**Claude isn't seeing my documents:**
- Ensure files are uploaded to Project (not just attached to message)
- Ask Claude: "Can you see my resume in the project files?"

**Responses are too complex:**
- Tell Claude: "Can you simplify this?"
- Adjust complexity level as needed

**Profile doesn't feel accurate:**
- Provide specific feedback: "This analysis about X doesn't match because..."
- Claude can revise based on your input

**Need more help:**
- See Troubleshooting section in the guide
- Remember: You're the expert on your career
